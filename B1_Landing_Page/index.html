            <h2> Bio </h2>
            <p> My name is Jacob nigh. I am 19 years old and I am from Greensboro, North Carolina. I have been coding since highschool. I found a great interest in learning coding langauges so, the course of my highschool career I focused on taking classes where I would learn these languages. Some of the classes that I took in highschool that involed coding were: E-Commerce I, E-Commerce II, and AP Computer Science. I've always loved to code but always liked the way certian web sites looked. I like websites that have fixed backgrounds where the whole page is like one column and the information is on each block of the column. I have always wanted to create a site like that but never had a really good idea with a lot of information to put it together. I enjoy lots of music generally hip-hop, trap, and electronic music. After I graduate from Full Sail I plan on moving back to North Carolina for a little while and then making a big move out west, probably Washington state or Portlandm, Oregon.
